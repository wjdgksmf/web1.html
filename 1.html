<h1>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/" target=_blank title="html15 speicification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web appliocations. ‎A set of commands used to describe HTML is called a tag. A tag basically consists of an opening tag and a closing tag, and there are tags that are used alone without a closing tag.</p>

By the way, there are more than a dozen types of tags, and if you list all the options that can be specified, it is the size of a book. Therefore, the general public only memorizes some frequently used tags, and the rest refer to the help file called 'tag dictionary (or reference)'. Of course, the scope of memorization widens as you go from advanced users to professionals (commonly referred to as web publishers).</p></body>
